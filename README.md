# StardewMods
My updated mods repository

The new repository that contains my updated mod projects in a much easier to traverse way!
Thanks to Advize, Alhifar, CJ A, CLxS and many others for helping me understand some of the annoying bits behind C#!

## Copyright

Fellow stardew modders though, are more then welcome to learn from, make use of and experiment with this code in the creation of their own stardew mods!

## Inactivity disclaimer and permissions
In the event that I have not been active on the chucklefish forums, SDV developer discord or SDV public discord for at least 30 days, I give permission for any willing SDV modder to fork, modify and distribute code from this repository.

In the event a new SDV and/or SMAPI version is released that breaks compatibility of my mods, the inactivity duration only needs to be 7 days for the above permission to be valid.

I ask that should I return after such a time, that the person who was kind enough to take over maintenance of my mods return them to myself.
